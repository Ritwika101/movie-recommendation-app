The model is built using K Nearest neighbors after transforming around 4700 movies into vectors. 
<br> The dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushsoni4/tmdb-5000-movie-dataset-with-ratings?resource=download
<br> Vectorization was done on the basis of movie cast, crew, overview, keywords genres etc. 
<br> I used Streamlit for the frontend. 
<br>Navigate here to see the app: https://ritwika-movie-recommendation.streamlit.app/
<br><br>The movie posters however are taken from Tmbdb api, and you need to generate your api key from here: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api and then paste it in the prompt.
